# Cogent Take Home Test

Hello!

My name is Julius. Thank you for looking into my code! I spent a few hours building it and I hope you think it's awesome. :grin:

## Structure

Here are the main folders:
  - `images` - image files
  - `src` - application source code
  - `tests` - application test code

## Setup

In the root directory run:
  - `npm install` - this will install all the Node.js libraries
  - Please install Node.js onto your machine if you have not already i.e. `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

## Running

To run the application, please enter:
  - `npm start` with relevant arguments

<!-- Here are some examples:
  - `npm start`
  - `npm start`
  - `npm start`
  - `npm start` -->

To run the tests, please enter:
  - `npm test`
  - You may need to install watchman onto your machine. I know I had issues with it for whatever reason i.e. `brew install watchman` (assuming you have brew installed)
